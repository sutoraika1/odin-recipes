            <p>8 Servings</p>
            <ul class="ingredient lava-cake">
                <li>½ cup unsalted butter (113g)</li>
                <li>6 ounces bittersweet chocolate chopped (168g)</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
                <li>¼ cup granulated sugar (50g)</li>
                <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            </ul>   
            <h4>Insturctions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 450F. Butter and lightly flour 6 (4- to 5-ounce) ramekins and place them on a baking sheet</li>
                <br>
                <li>Combine the butter and chocolate in a double boiler and melt over low heat, stirring until smooth.
                    <br>Or, place the butter and chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high, stirring every 30-seconds until melted. Whisk together until smooth.</li>
                <br>
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the eggs, egg yolks, sugar, and salt. Beat on medium speed until thick and pale yellow.
                    <br>Fold the chocolate mixture and flour into the egg mixture until well combined. Divide the batter among the prepared ramekins.</li>
                <li>Bake for 6 to 8 minutes or until the sides of the cakes are firm set but the center is jiggly. Let the cakes cool in the ramekins for 1 minute.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Place a small dessert plate over the top of each ramekin and carefully turn it over, inverting the cake onto the plate. Let stand for about 10 seconds, 
                    <br>then remove the ramekin to unmold the cakes. Sift powdered sugar on top and garnish with berries, if desired. Serve immediately.</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>Notes</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not pack the flour into the measuring spoon. Fluff the flour and then sprinkle it into the tablespoons. 
                    <br>You do not want to add too much flour to the lava cake batter as it'll make the center firm.</li>
                <li>Make sure the oven is fully heated before adding the ramekins inside. The high temperature helps the exterior
                    <br> of the cake bake faster than the inside. This leaves you with the exterior perfectly cooked while the chocolate lava filling stays gooey!</li>
                <li>Use room temperature eggs, so they mix into the batter without over-mixing. Place your eggs in a bowl of warm tap water if they are cold.</li>
                <li>Keep a very close eye on the lava cakes in the oven as you do not want them to overbake. The center should still be jiggy.</li>
            </ul>
