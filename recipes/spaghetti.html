        <br>
        <h4>Insturctions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a dutch oven or large heavy bottomed pot over medium high. Add a bit of oil, the ground beef,<br> and sausage,
            breaking the meat apart into small pieces as it cooks - I use a meat smasher for this. </li>
            <br>
            <li>When the meat begins to brown and is well broken down, stir in the onion, garlic,<br> 
            and a pinch of salt, making sure to scrape up any meat fond stuck to the bottom of the pot. Cover and cook for 5 minutes</li>
            <br>
            <li>Now is a good time to preheat your oven to 425F/220C</li>
            <br>
            <li>After 5 minutes of cooking, stir in oregano, chile flake, and tomato paste and cook for a minute or so until tomato paste is well incorporated. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Stir in bouillon and can of crushed tomatoes, water, 6-8g/1.5tsp salt, 7-8g/2tsp sugar and bring to a simmer.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Stir in basil. Add in spaghetti and gently stir and press down to submerge noodles. Simmer for about 60 seconds.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Carefully stir noodles again to fully submerge noodles.Transfer the pot to the oven to cook,<br>
            uncovered for 16-18 min, gently stirring and submerging at 5 and 10 minutes into cooking. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Taste for doneness and seasoning and adjust if necessary. Stir in grated parm. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Garnish with additional parm.</li>
        </ol>
